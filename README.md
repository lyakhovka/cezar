This program works with the Caesar cipher. The basis of the cryptographic alphabet is the English alphabet. If the sourse text contains any other symbols they are left as they are. The result you will find in a file next to the source file.

Run the program with the command 'java -jar Cezar.jar \<command\> \<filePath\> \<key\>', where

\<command\> is one of 'ENCRYPT', 'DECRYPT', 'BRUTE_FORCE';

\<filePath\> is the absolute path to the file with the source text;

\<key\> is the cypher key. In case of BRUTE_FORCE command the key is omitted.


You may use sample files commited here for testing:
 - secret_for_BRUTE_FORCE
 - secret_for_DECRYPT_for_key_12
 - secret_for_ENCRYPT
